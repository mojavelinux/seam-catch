   <title>Installation</title>
   <para>
      To use the Seam Catch module, you need to add the Seam Catch API to your project as a compile-time dependency. At
      runtime, you'll also need the Seam Catch implementation, which you either specify explicitly or through a
      transitive dependency of another module that depends on it (as part of exposing its own Catch integration).
   </para>

   <para>
      First, check your application's library dependencies to see whether Seam Catch is already being included by
      another module (such as Seam Servlet). If not, you'll need to setup the dependencies as described below.
   </para>
   
   <para>
      If you are using <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</ulink> as your build tool, add the following
      dependency to your pom.xml file to include the Seam Catch API at compile time:
   </para>

   <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.jboss.seam.catch</groupId>
   <artifactId>seam-catch-api</artifactId>
   <version>${seam-catch-version}</version>
   <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>]]>
   </programlisting>

   <para>
      To include the Seam Catch implementation at runtime, also add the following dependency to your pom.xml:
   </para>

   <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.jboss.seam.catch</groupId>
   <artifactId>seam-catch-impl</artifactId>
   <version>${seam-catch-version}</version>
   <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>]]>
   </programlisting>
   <tip>
      <para>
         Replace ${seam-catch-version} with the most recent or appropriate version of Seam Catch.
      </para>
   </tip>
